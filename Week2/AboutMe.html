        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Benedict Ochieng' Odhiambo. I am a 24 year old Kenya living in the country side, and from a humble and religious background. Since I was 13 years old and started interacting with phones and computers, I have had a very burning desiore to be part of the big group of programmers and developers that move the world using tech. This desire grew into passion and it has been driving me to learn; even though I haven't been able to afford paying for the classes to get the class knowledge of programming and anything computer related. <br>
        However, I am currently chasing my dream under the scholarship from Ingressive for Good and Zuri training.</p>

        <p>I am also passionate about service to humanity because of my love for God, I get my motivation from the quote, "Service to humanity is service to God." I am a friend to anything that brings me closer to God. <br> I am also someone who is self motivated and can always work <strong><em>solo</em></strong>and work hard too. My hard work is always kept going by my dream of one day owning a tech company but still maintaning my country-side life. The last thing that motivates me to be a hard worker is the desire to change the face of my village, not as a politician but just from the desire of seeing change where youths are able to be in school without breaks due to fee issues...(<em>the list could be longer than this</em>)</p>
        <p>My hobbies are swimming, fishing, reading the Bible and researching and learning about tech. I prioritize service to God(which includes service to humanity) and my family. Some of the skills I have are basic landscaping and home design, basic martial arts skills and finnaly painting skills.</p>
